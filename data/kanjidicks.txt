You shouldnt need a damn story for this, but I am drunk so here goes: Two mouths. One yelling, "Dont look at the sun you idiot." and the other yelling, "Dood it will be awesome, You can see sun men all hanging out in there smoking sun -reefer, I swear to god, man, this dude told me it, go ahead."

DESCRIPTION: As a radical, it usually means "bright".

COCK: This kanji has not one but two ON-yomis, and as if that wasnt enough, most of the jukugo dont use either of them! This is by far the worst kanji when it comes to not following the rules of pronunciation. Luckily, most of the FP words youll use every day, right from your first day in Noob Nihongo, so youll learn em without even trying.

ONYOMI: MAN

The egotistical MAN neglected his heart and let the sun shine on his crotch instead.

DESCRIPTION:COCK: 90% of the words using this kanji mean egotistical, neglectful OR even chronic (for example, 怠慢,meaning negligence, dereliction )

But of course since this is Japanese, the one exception - 我慢 (meaning patience) is used 90% of the time!!
JUKUGO:

我慢 する ( がまん する)
    to endure, to bear something. Often translated as patience, but that is not quite right. You have patience if you can do data entry on a fucking kanji dictionary for 5 hours straight, but you gaman with your overtime or while taking final exams with a burst appendix.

    Masochists tend to gaman when theyre fed worms while tied up.

    Sometimes the concept of gaman DOES overlap with the English idea of patience, though: Little kids have to gaman if they find out that Disneyland is still 4 hours away.

    One possible way to make GAMAN fit with the theme of neglect is to remember that the ga part means self. So GAMAN means neglect yourself, or, more poetically, Stop feeling the pain of your body and mind, and concentrate on the task at hand. (CCW, 1 or 2 KANA)
    我 (we) + 慢 (neglect or  egotistic) = 我慢 (persevere)

DESCRIPTION: BOOBOO: people think this means "ASIA," but it doesnt. A while ago, just as a pun, some Japanese decided to spell the word "ASIA" phonetically, using kanji, like so: 亜細亜：あじあ: but this custom never caught on. And besides, the 亜 kanji was only chosen for its sound, not for its meaning.

亜 is used in a lot of names of elements, like chalk or zinc, but unless youre a research chemist or terrorist, this doesnt concern you.

海岸 ( かいがん )
    the coast OR the beach! Unlike 浜辺 or 浜, 海岸 has a scientific meaning: the coastline, (regardless of if theres sand or not). Youll see 海岸 on maps or geography books. The useage of 海岸 is odd, even for Japanese. Where Americans will just say, "Lets go to the beach!", Japanese might suggest to their pals, "海へ行こう！”（lets go to the ocean!) but ONLY ONCE THEY WERE ALREADY THERE, then they might specifically suggest going to the 海岸 - as opposed to other things to do by the sea. Weird!

    One possible way to make GAMAN fit with the theme of neglect is to remember that the ga part means self. So GAMAN means neglect yourself, or, more poetically, Stop feeling the pain of your body and mind, and concentrate on the task at hand. (CCW, 1 or 2 KANA)

Taskmaster director
PK
(right radical)

DESCRIPTION:Helsig calls this incredibly common radical the TASKMASTER, because it usually shows up in kanji about learning or organized procedures.

That makes sense, but I prefer to call him the DIRECTOR, as you can easily picture his imperious figure sitting on this cliche Hollywood directors chair with the crossed legs:
. . .the tallness of the chair allows him to oversee his underlings every move, and hector them appropriately.

LOOKALIKES：

Lack (欠)is spreading its legs because it LACKS good manners,but the directors chair, by definition, has crossed legs.

遠慮 する ( えんりょ する)
    CULTURAL CODE WORD in full effect. Meaning, its such a uniquely Japanese concept there is no ready English equivalent.

    遠慮 means to be diplomatically, politely refuse, to regretfully decline.

    For example, "You want the last donut?" "Hell yes!" is not 遠慮.

    But, "No way I dont want it, it smells!" is also not 遠慮 .

    "Thanks but Im full now." is the 遠慮 answer, since it means, "We both know I want it, but since I abstained from it, you owe me one, now! The favor-ball is back in my court!"

    Used most commonly in two situations：

    1) 遠慮せず： meaning, Act casual. Eat the last pie. Dont wait for all the food to be served. Sit wherever. Make yourself at home.

    2) its often seen on signs telling you not to do something: XXX遠慮してくさい。 (Please refrain from doing XXX) (CCW, F)
